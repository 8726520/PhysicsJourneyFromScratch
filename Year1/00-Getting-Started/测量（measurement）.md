Measurement is the cornerstone for humanity to understand and transform the world.
It serves as:
The Eye of Science: Turning qualitative descriptions into quantitative analysis, it is the key that propels science from empirical experience to theoretical rigor.
The Hand of Technology: The fundamental guarantee for the realization of modern industry, engineering, and information technology.
The Ruler of Society: The bedrock for regulating markets, safeguarding fairness, and fostering communication and cooperation.
No measurement, no modern science and civilization. Every advancement in measurement marks the expansion of humanity's cognitive boundaries and the leap of technological capabilities.

测量是人类认识和改造世界的基石。

它是：

科学之眼：使定性描述变为定量分析，是科学从经验走向理论的关键。

技术之手：是现代工业、工程和信息技术得以实现的保证。

社会之尺：是规范市场、保障公平、促进交流与合作的基础。
